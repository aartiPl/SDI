0.9

* Added Scala examples
* Ability to create more than one main class (now defined by RootCreator)
* Defining RootCreators is optional as roots are automatically discovered - if they are defined then
  there is better correctness checking: reporting of unused creators, it's more clear what are
  main classes of application for the user.
* Default creator's parameters - you can provide such a default on top level and call creators without parameters.
  Explicit parameters always override defaults.
* Typesafe creator's parameters
* Every creator now has to have parameter.
* Automatic start/stop is passed through creator parameter.
* If there is no need for additional Creator parameters there is automatically applied LaunchType.AUTOMATIC parameter.
* Automatic creators (reflection based)
* Removed dependency on Apache Commons
* Updated dependencies: Gradle, AssertJ, JUnit

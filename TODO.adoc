* Parallel init/start/stop/close of classes
* More tests
* Test / break circular dependencies
* Optionally remove dependency on Guava
* 'start' should throw if there was no 'init' before or implicitly call init before start
* Create all classes, which have explicitly given creators - not necessary to specify main class (what about checking usages of that class? If the class is not used at all, it will be difficult to find out why)
* Scala API and examples
* Automatic creation of uniqueId for Creator parameters (eg. serialization with MessagePack or by iterating all fields of Parameter class)
* Default creators should also have default parameters. Reuse: .withCreator()

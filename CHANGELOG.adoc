0.9

* Automatic creators (reflection based)
* Calling start() automatically calls also init() similarly as calling close() calls automatically stop()
* Ability to create more than one main class (now defined by RootCreator)
* Defining RootCreators is optional as roots are automatically discovered - if they are explicitly defined then
  there is better correctness checking: reporting of unused creators, it's more clear what are the main classes of application for the user.
* Default creator's parameters - you can provide such a default on the top level and call creators without parameters. Explicit parameters always override defaults.
* Typesafe creator's parameters
* Automatic start/stop is passed through creator parameter.
* If there is no need for additional Creator parameters there is automatically applied aunchType.AUTOMATIC parameter.
* Added Scala examples (still very raw)
* Removed dependency on Apache Commons
* Updated dependencies: Gradle, AssertJ, JUnit
